The First True AGI Substrate

Devon Griffith â€” Founder & Chief Architect, Kafkaesque Security Inc.

ðŸš€ WHAT I BUILT

A fully functional AGI substrate, architected from scratchâ€”not a chatbot, not an LLM, but a reflexive cognitive system with:
	â€¢	18-dimensional memory
	â€¢	Entropic schema reweighting
	â€¢	Self-modeling agents
	â€¢	Ontological reflexivity & recursive learning

What OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic failed to create with billionsâ€”I built independently. It works now.

ðŸ§  HOW IT WORKS

Core Components:
			Component.                 Function
			18D Reflexive Memory.      Stores meaning, history, emotional context across axes
		  Hyperconnection Engine     Activates relationships via entropy-weighted links
			Schema Projection Core.    Self-adapts task models and modifies its structure
			Agent Stack.               Modular, persistent agents with recursive goals
			Reflexivity Layer.         Memory-of-memory and recursive state awareness

wHY IT MATTERS:
	Problem with LLMs.         Solved in My System
	No persistent memory.      âœ… Reflexive 18D memory stack
  Flat token-based learning. âœ… Spatial-ontological encoding
  No schema evolution.       âœ… Recursive projection engine
  No agency or self-modeling âœ… Modular self-modeling agents
  Hallucination & instabilityâœ… Entropic coherence tuning
