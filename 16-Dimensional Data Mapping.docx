Diffuse Intelligence (D2, D8, D11, D12, D16)
Non-agentic, emergent intelligence that arises from distributed fields, signal networks, or system-environment
coupling. Lacks centralized control or memory, yet supports emergent cognition and proto-conscious
properties. AGI-aligned by design.

Reflexive AI (D6, D7, D13, D16)
Self-aware, architecture-adaptive intelligence capable of reasoning about its own reasoning, states, and
processes.

Cognitive Architectures (D1, D5, D6, D13, D1, D16)
Artificial systems modeled after human cognitive processes. Often involve memory, planning, reasoning, and
learning subsystems.

Hybrid AI (D1, D2, D5, D6, D7, D13, D16)
Combines symbolic, connectionist, probabilistic, and reflexive elements into a unified architecture.

Embodied AI (D3, D12, D4, D8)
AI grounded in physical or virtual bodies, allowing interaction with an environment through sensors and
effectors.

Neuromorphic AI (D2, D4, D12, D15)
AI modeled directly on neural circuits at the hardware level; fast and efficient but limited in abstraction.

Symbolic/Probabilistic AI (D1, D5, D9, D1)
Explicit rule-based or statistical logic systems; interpretable but narrow in scope.
